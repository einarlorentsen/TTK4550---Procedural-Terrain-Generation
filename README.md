# Specialization-Project
TTK4550 - Specialization Project with Jostein Sætra Schefte and Einar Lorentsen. 

The project was done in the Unity Game Engine about procedural terrain generation with river and road networks. Complex networks, such as rivers and roads, has been a problem for games applying procedural generation. As a result, popular games such as *No Man's Sky* lack these features. 

By implementing a noiseless procedural terrain generator complex networks could be created. Also, the use of expensive search algorithms to search through already defined terrain was avoided. The implementation was done in C# and can be found in: **Main Project → Assets → Scripts**.
